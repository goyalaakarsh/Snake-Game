# Classic Snake Game

Welcome to the Classic Snake Game! This project is a simple implementation of the timeless Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Relive the nostalgia of the classic Snake game and challenge yourself to achieve the highest score possible.

## Game Controls

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
- Press `Enter` to Start the game.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to control the snake, guiding it to consume the food that appears on the game board. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, making the game more challenging. Be careful not to collide with the walls or yourself, as that will end the game.
